# gosqlparse (work in progress)

This directory contains an experimental Go port of the Python `sqlparse` library.
Currently the project contains basic type definitions and a minimal lexer
implementation capable of tokenizing simple SQL statements. Further work will
mirror the original project's statement splitting, grouping logic and
formatting utilities.
